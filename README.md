# Evangelist Dag daily Devotional

This is a web application built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. This app reads markdown posts through the github api pushed on github.

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to share daily devotionals from Bishop Dag Heward Mills with readers who seek spiritual inspiration and insights. The app aims to create a platform where users can access and engage with the teachings, reflect on the messages, and deepen their relationship with God.
